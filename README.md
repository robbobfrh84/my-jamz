# Notes (Questions, bugs, issues, thoughts)

The music playlist part is confusing.
- 1. `data.json` won't work locally. You'll have to run a server. 
  - `data.js` works better
- 2. There isn't a clear guide to how many playlists, how many songs, etc..
  - HOWEVER, if this is an AI exercise, it's prefect.
